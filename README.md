    First Citizen:
    Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

    All:
    Speak, speak.

    First Citizen:
    You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

    All:
    Resolved. resolved.

    First Citizen:
    First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

    All:
    We know't, we know't.

    First Citizen:
    Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
    Is't a verdict?

    All:
    No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

    Second Citizen:
    One word, good citizens.

    First Citizen:
    We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
    What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
    would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
    wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
    but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
    afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
    inventory to particularise their abundance; our
    sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
    our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
    speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Get all unique characters:

Create the encoder and decoders:

``` python
stoi = {ch:i for i, ch in enumerate(chars)}
itos = {i:ch for i, ch in enumerate(chars)}
encode = lambda s: [stoi[ch] for ch in s]
decode = lambda l: ''.join([itos[i] for i in l])
```

    [46, 47, 1, 58, 46, 43, 56, 43]

``` python
print(encode('hi there'))
print(decode(encode('hi there')))
```

    [46, 47, 1, 58, 46, 43, 56, 43]
